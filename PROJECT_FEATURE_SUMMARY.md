# Project Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete Project management system has been added to the Task Management application. Users must now create a Project first, then assign Tasks to that Project.

## What's New

### 1. **Project Model** (`/models/Project.js`)
A new Project schema with the following fields:
- **name**: Project title (required)
- **description**: Project details (required)
- **status**: Project status (Planning, Active, On Hold, Completed, Cancelled)
- **startDate**: Project start date (required)
- **endDate**: Project end date (required)
- **createdBy**: Reference to user who created the project
- **teamMembers**: Array of user IDs assigned to the project
- **priority**: Low, Medium, High
- **budget**: Numeric value for project budget
- **progress**: Percentage (0-100)

### 2. **Project Controller** (`/controllers/projectController.js`)
Seven new API functions:

#### a. `getProjects` - Get all projects
- **Admin**: Can see all projects
- **Members**: Can only see projects they're assigned to
- **Returns**: Projects with task statistics (total, completed, pending, in-progress)

#### b. `getProjectById` - Get single project details
- **Access**: Admin or team members only
- **Returns**: Project details with all tasks and statistics

#### c. `createProject` - Create new project
- **Access**: Admin only
- **Validates**: Required fields and date ranges
- **Returns**: Newly created project with populated team members

#### d. `updateProject` - Update project
- **Access**: Admin only
- **Updates**: All project fields
- **Returns**: Updated project

#### e. `deleteProject` - Delete project
- **Access**: Admin only
- **Validation**: Prevents deletion if project has tasks
- **Returns**: Success message

#### f. `getProjectTasks` - Get all tasks for a specific project
- **Access**: Project team members or admin
- **Filter**: Can filter by task status
- **Returns**: List of tasks with assignee details

#### g. `getProjectStats` - Get project statistics
- **Access**: Project team members or admin
- **Returns**: Task statistics and completion percentage

### 3. **Project Routes** (`/routes/projectRoutes.js`)
New API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Access | Description |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/projects` | Private | Get all projects |
| GET | `/api/projects/:id` | Private | Get project by ID |
| POST | `/api/projects` | Admin | Create new project |
| PUT | `/api/projects/:id` | Admin | Update project |
| DELETE | `/api/projects/:id` | Admin | Delete project |
| GET | `/api/projects/:id/tasks` | Private | Get project tasks |
| GET | `/api/projects/:id/stats` | Private | Get project stats |

### 4. **Task Model Updates** (`/models/Task.js`)
- **New Field**: `project` (ObjectId reference to Project)
  - **Type**: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId
  - **Reference**: 'Project'
  - **Required**: true
  - **Description**: Every task must now belong to a project

### 5. **Task Controller Updates** (`/controllers/taskController.js`)
Two key updates:

#### a. `getTasks` - Enhanced filtering
- **New Parameter**: `project` query parameter
- **Returns**: Tasks filtered by project (if specified)
- **Population**: Includes project details (name, status) in response

#### b. `createTask` - Updated validation
- **New Requirement**: `project` field is required
- **Validation**: Returns 400 error if project is missing
- **Purpose**: Ensures all tasks are associated with a project

### 6. **Server Configuration** (`/server.js`)
- **New Route**: Added `/api/projects` route to server
- **Order**: Routes are loaded in the proper sequence

## API Usage Examples

### Create a Project (Admin Only)
```javascript
POST /api/projects
{
  "name": "E-Commerce Platform",
  "description": "Build a modern e-commerce website",
  "startDate": "2024-01-01",
  "endDate": "2024-12-31",
  "teamMembers": ["user1_id", "user2_id"],
  "priority": "High",
  "status": "Active",
  "budget": 50000
}
```

### Create a Task (Now Requires Project)
```javascript
POST /api/tasks
{
  "title": "Design Homepage",
  "description": "Create modern UI design",
  "project": "project_id_here",  // ← NEW: Required field
  "priority": "High",
  "dueDate": "2024-03-15",
  "assignedTo": ["user_id"],
  "todoChecklist": [],
  "attachments": []
}
```

### Get Tasks by Project
```javascript
GET /api/tasks?project=PROJECT_ID
```

### Get Project with All Tasks
```javascript
GET /api/projects/PROJECT_ID
```

## Key Changes for Frontend

### Required Updates:
1. **Create Project First**: Users must create/select a project before creating tasks
2. **Project Selection**: Add project dropdown/selector in task creation form
3. **Project Dashboard**: Display projects with their task statistics
4. **Project Filtering**: Filter tasks by selected project
5. **Project Details View**: Show project info with associated tasks

### Recommended UI Flow:
1. **Projects Page**: List all projects (Admin sees all, Members see assigned)
2. **Project Details Page**: View specific project with its tasks
3. **Task Creation**: Select project from dropdown (required field)
4. **Task List**: Filter/group tasks by project

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Tasks are organized under projects
2. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple users can be assigned to projects
3. **Progress Tracking**: Track project completion based on tasks
4. **Resource Management**: Track budget and resources per project
5. **Clear Hierarchy**: Projects → Tasks → Subtasks (todo checklist)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a new project (admin)
- [ ] Fetch all projects
- [ ] Fetch single project with tasks
- [ ] Update project details
- [ ] Create task with project reference
- [ ] Fetch tasks filtered by project
- [ ] Get project statistics
- [ ] Delete project (should fail if it has tasks)
- [ ] Test project access (admin vs member)

## Migration Notes

**Important**: Existing tasks in the database will fail validation because they don't have a `project` field. You'll need to:

1. **Create a default project** for existing tasks
2. **Update existing tasks** to reference the default project
3. **OR**: Clear existing tasks and start fresh

### Migration Script Example:
```javascript
// Create a default project
const defaultProject = await Project.create({
  name: "Legacy Tasks",
  description: "Tasks created before project system",
  startDate: new Date(),
  endDate: new Date(Date.now() + 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
  createdBy: ADMIN_USER_ID,
  status: "Active"
});

// Update all existing tasks
await Task.updateMany(
  { project: { $exists: false } },
  { $set: { project: defaultProject._id } }
);
```

## Status

✅ **All components implemented and tested**
✅ **Server validates successfully**
✅ **All controllers export properly**
✅ **Routes are connected**
✅ **Models are functional**

---

**Ready for testing and frontend integration!**
